## Library Shelf react add in

For example you can see a library shelf programmed as a react app that's easy to put wherever you want on your website. It uses the Zotero Web Library and its WebApi as a backend and fetches data from there. To find out more look in the repo [here](https://github.com/marcel-tronco/zotero_library_react_addin)!
